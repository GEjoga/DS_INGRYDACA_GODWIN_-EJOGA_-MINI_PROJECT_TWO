- Display whether the target item was found or not in the list.
- Return a closing/welcome message
- OBJECTIVES
- Apply object-oriented programming principles to design classes for tasks and users.
- Practice working with data structures like lists and dictionaries for task management.
- Implement decorators to add additional functionality to tasks. - Gain experience in implementing a command-line application with functions and classes
